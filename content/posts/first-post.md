TinySilos! is a concept project for quickly building isolated infrastructure (Silos) in a way that doesn't require adopting complex all-in-one solutions like Kubernetes. To do this, we use focused/tailored software services that do *one thing really well*.

A full list of the features we hope to support:
* Secrets management
* Configuration management & service discovery
* Process scheduling and runtime orchestration
* Auditing and observability (structured logging, metrics and tracing)

This is a _very early stage_ project and all of the choices we make are subject to change at any time. This project
is *not* ready for public consumption or production use.
